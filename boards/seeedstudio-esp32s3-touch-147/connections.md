# Seeed Studio XIAO 1.47" Touch Display (ESP32-S3)

Env: `seeedstudio-esp32s3-touch-147`

A display board for the XIAO series, sold mated to a **XIAO ESP32-S3 Plus**
(ESP32-S3R8 — 16 MB flash, 8 MB octal PSRAM). The display board itself has no
MCU; everything below is a XIAO pad, so the pinout is only meaningful together
with the XIAO ESP32-S3 Plus pad map.

## D-number → GPIO

The wiki documents this board in XIAO **D-numbers**; the firmware needs raw
GPIOs. The mapping is from `variants/XIAO_ESP32S3_Plus/pins_arduino.h` in
arduino-esp32 and is **not** the same as the plain XIAO ESP32-S3 above D10.

| D | GPIO | | D | GPIO |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D0 | 1 | | D10 | 9 |
| D1 | 2 | | D11 | 38 |
| D2 | 3 | | D12 | 39 |
| D3 | 4 | | D13 | 40 |
| D4 | 5 | | D14 | 41 |
| D5 | 6 | | D15 | 42 |
| D6 | 43 | | D16 | 10 |
| D7 | 44 | | D17 | 13 |

Present on the board but unused by the Launcher: a LSM6DS3 6-axis IMU (same
I2C bus as touch, INT on D14/GPIO41), a PDM microphone (CLK D0/GPIO1, DATA
D1/GPIO2) and an I2S output (SD D11/GPIO38, SCK D12/GPIO39, WS D13/GPIO40).

## Bus sharing

**SPI** — the panel and the microSD share one bus (SCK 7, MOSI 9, MISO 8).
`sd_functions.cpp` detects this from `TFT_MOSI == SDCARD_MOSI` and mounts the
card on the already-initialized global `SPI` object instead of opening a second
`SPIClass`. `_setup_gpio()` parks `SDCARD_CS` high before the panel comes up so
the card can't answer the panel's traffic.

**I2C** — touch and the (unused) IMU share `Wire` on SDA 5 / SCL 6.
`hal_touch_init()` is what calls `Wire.begin()` on this board.

**Reset** — the panel and the touch controller share GPIO13. This is why
`hal_touch_init()` runs from `_post_setup_gpio()` (after `tft->begin()`) with
`DeviceTouch.pin_rst` left at `-1`: the panel's own reset has already pulsed
the line, and pulsing it again would blank the initialized panel.

**UART0** — GPIO43/44 (D6/D7) are UART0 TX/RX, and the board uses them as SD CS
and touch INT. That is fine only because the console is the ESP32-S3 native USB
(`ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1`); there is no usable serial console on this board.

## Display

JD9853A, 172×320 IPS, SPI, **BGR**, inversion **off**.

The Launcher drives it with **`TFT_DISPLAY_DRIVER_N=2` (`Arduino_ST7796`)**
rather than the ST7789 you would expect from a 172×320 panel. Two reasons, both
from the vendor's own driver (`Seeed_GFX2/src/driver/tft/Driver_JD9853A.*`):

1. The glass is BGR. Arduino_GFX's `Arduino_ST7789` hard-codes
   `ST7789_MADCTL_RGB` (0x00) in every rotation and has no BGR path, so red and
   blue would swap. `Arduino_ST7796` sets `ST7796_MADCTL_BGR` (0x08) in all of
   them. `TFT_RGB_ORDER` does **not** help here — the Arduino_GFX backend
   ignores `displayConfig.rgbOrder` (only the LovyanGFX backend reads it).
2. Seeed's own driver notes that an `Arduino_ST7796` initialization is one of
   the two known-working paths on this glass (the other being their
   ST7789-compatible sequence). The ST7796 init table is panel-size agnostic —
   COLMOD, gamma, power, SLPOUT, DISPON — so it carries nothing 320×480
   specific into a 172×320 panel.

`TFT_IPS=0` because `Arduino_TFT::tftInit()` ends in `invertDisplay(false)`,
which sends `INVOFF` when `ips` is false — the state the vendor driver forces
explicitly for this glass.

### Window offsets

The controller RAM is 240 wide and the glass is the centre 172 columns, so the
column axis carries a 34 px offset ((240−172)/2) and the row axis none. With
`TFT_COL_OFS1=34 / TFT_ROW_OFS1=0 / TFT_COL_OFS2=34 / TFT_ROW_OFS2=0`,
`Arduino_TFT::setRotation()` lands the 34 on CASET at rotation 0 and on RASET
at rotations 1 and 7 — correct in each case, since MADCTL's MV bit swaps which
command addresses the narrow axis.

### Why `ROTATION=3` + `ROT_OFFSET=4`

Arduino_GFX offers eight rotations: 0–3 are the four 90° steps measured from
`MADCTL = 0`, and 4–7 are the same four steps measured from `MADCTL = MX`.
Those are two different families — one is the other mirrored — and only one
matches how the glass is actually bonded.

Seeed's driver pins the answer: it sets `MADCTL = MX | BGR` (0x48) for its
portrait and calls that value "verified" on the XIAO Display Board. A family
based at `MX` is Arduino_GFX's **4–7**, which map one-for-one onto the vendor's
rotations:

| vendor rotation | MADCTL | Arduino_GFX |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (portrait) | `MX` | 4 |
| 1 (landscape) | `MV` | **7** |
| 2 (portrait) | `MY` | 6 |
| 3 (landscape) | `MX\|MY\|MV` | 5 |

So landscape — the sane orientation for a 1.47" launcher UI, and what the
comparable `waveshare-esp32-s3-lcd-147` ships — is rotation **7**, giving
320×172 with `MADCTL = MV | BGR` (0x28).

`gsetRotation()` in `settings.cpp` already understands a mount rotation above
3: it offers "Default (7)" and otherwise only lets the user pick from 0–3.
Picking one of those on this panel will look vertically mirrored, because they
are the other family. That is a cosmetic quirk of a board whose natural
rotation isn't in 0–3, not a bug — "Default (7)" restores it.

## Touch

AXS5106L at a fixed I2C address **0x63**. SensorLib has no driver for this
chip and `lib/SensorLib` is a submodule, so `TOUCH_CTRL_AXS5106L` carries a
small self-contained driver inside `src/hal/inputs/touch.cpp`: one 14-byte
report read from register 0x01, where byte 1 is the touch count and each point
packs 12-bit X/Y as a low nibble plus a low byte.

INT (GPIO44) is treated as a hint, not a gate: the vendor driver notes some
revisions leave it high with a finger down, so a high INT only defers the read
to a ~60 Hz poll. The driver reports raw panel-native (portrait) coordinates
and lets the HAL's host-side `SwapXY`/`MirrorX`/`MirrorY` table rotate them,
the same way `TOUCH_CTRL_FT6X36` works.

## Still unverified on hardware

This port was written from the wiki, the vendor library and the arduino-esp32
variant header; it builds clean but has **not** been run on the device. In
likely order of needing a fix:

1. **Touch orientation.** `touchCfg()`'s mirror/swap table is derived from the
   MADCTL/mirror pairs in the vendor driver, not from touching the four
   corners. Note that index 3 of that table is populated for rotation **7**
   (the shipped one), not rotation 3 — they collide on `rotation & 3`.
2. **Panel orientation.** `ROTATION=7` is reasoned from the vendor's verified
   `MADCTL=0x48` portrait, above. If the image is upside down, `ROTATION=5` is
   the same family's other landscape; if it comes up mirrored instead, the
   `MX`-based family assumption is wrong and `ROTATION=1` is the fix.
3. **Colour order / inversion.** If red and blue are swapped, the glass is RGB
   after all → `TFT_DISPLAY_DRIVER_N=1` (`Arduino_ST7789`). If the image is a
   photographic negative, flip `TFT_IPS`.
4. **Battery scale.** `ANALOG_BAT_MULTIPLIER=2.975f` comes from the wiki's
   stated 316K/160K divider ((316+160)/160), not from a measurement.
5. **SPI clock.** `TFT_PREF_SPEED=40000000` is the repo's conservative default
   for a shared SPI bus, not a figure from the JD9853A datasheet.

## Inputs

Two user buttons, via `HAS_2_BUTTONS` + `BUTTONS_IDF_COMPONENT` (the
`ESP32_Button` component, pulled in by `lib_deps`):

- **USR1** (GPIO11): short click → Next, double click or hold → Sel
- **USR2** (GPIO42): short click → Prev, double click or hold → Esc

plus the touchscreen. The XIAO's own BOOT button (GPIO0) is not used by the
Launcher — it may not be reachable once the boards are stacked.

## Power

No PMIC and no fuel gauge: a 2-pin JST LiPo header read straight off the
XIAO's `ADC_BAT` (GPIO10) through the 316K/160K divider, handled by the generic
`ANALOG_BAT_PIN`/`ANALOG_BAT_MULTIPLIER` path in `mykeyboard.cpp` (so this
board defines no `getBattery()` of its own). There is no charge-status line, so
`isCharging()` is left at its default.

`powerOff()` turns the backlight off and deep-sleeps with an ext0 wake on USR1
(GPIO11, active low).

## Flashing

ESP32-S3, so the bootloader goes at **0x0**:

```
esptool --chip esp32s3 write-flash \
  0x0     .pio/build/seeedstudio-esp32s3-touch-147/bootloader.bin \
  0x8000  .pio/build/seeedstudio-esp32s3-touch-147/partitions.bin \
  0x10000 .pio/build/seeedstudio-esp32s3-touch-147/firmware.bin
```
